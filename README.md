# Python-Fibonacci-Retracement-Framework

- This is my first fully automated python programming for day trading with the Fibunacci retracement tool.

Note on frequency finding:

1) A sequence can only be created at the beginning or end of a movement.

2) A sequence cannot be created in the middle of a movement except when it is the result of a larger sequence that is already active.

3) A point 0 usually represents the start of the movement, often as an absolute high or low.

4) Point A is only A when the market starts to correct the 0-A move and runs to our entry level.

5) A sequence is simply activated when A is exceeded or undershot, so that the bulls/bears continue to prevail and the probabilities are higher that the sequence will reach the target level than they would be if the sequence were not activated.

Notes on trade management:

1) Risks

1.1 Risk a maximum of 1-3% per trade - for a small account do not risk 1-3% per trade, but divide!

2) Diversiﬁkation

2.1 Trade all markets if they give a valid entry.
2.2 Ideally, hedge situations arise.

3) Targets 

CRV
100% Correction
100% extension
161-200 extension

4) StopLoss

4.1 Reduce risk = halve SL / max 5 pips SL
4.2 Move to BE if the trade is in a bull/bear correction level before the double proﬁt.
4.3 SL is not tightened (except on BE) - trade then runs BE or into target
4.4 Spread is not taken into account
4.5 SL for single trade at C-target: 20 pips above the 200 extension level!

5) Entry

5.1 Take spread into account
5.2 Entry areas should not overlap with the SL of the previous level.
5.3 The entry is traded as long as it is valid.
5.4 If SL of 50 entry covers all ranges (50-66.7) -> reduce 50 entry SL to be able to place a valid entry at 66.7.
valid entry at 66.7.

6) General
6.1 If x trades are in SL and then there is the possibility to balance the losses with one trade -> TP!
6.2 Profits should be realised on the same day.
6.3 Trading with the sequence is less risky than trading against the sequence.
6.4 The C wave can theoretically go on indefinitely.
6.5 Target area is considered to be worked off at 5 pips tolerance before the 161.8
6.6 Correction of the BC movement always represents a reentry (if the sequence is activated).
6.7 Reaction at 200 target level followed by processing of correction level (0)->(C) target level gives no more entries.
6.8 If trade is stopped out after BE setting -> re-enter immediately.
6.9 From a sequence-technical point of view, the market may continue to point 0 (if B-C movement is dominant, impulsive).
only the 50-66.7 KL counts.
