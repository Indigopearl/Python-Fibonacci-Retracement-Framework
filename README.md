# Python-Fibonacci-Retracement-Framework

- This is my first fully automated python programming for day trading with the Fibunacci retracement tool.

Note on frequency finding:

1) A sequence can only be created at the beginning or end of a movement.

2) A sequence cannot be created in the middle of a movement except when it is the result of a larger sequence that is already active.

3) A point 0 usually represents the start of the movement, often as an absolute high or low.

4) Point A is only A when the market starts to correct the 0-A move and runs to our entry level.

5) A sequence is simply activated when A is exceeded or undershot, so that the bulls/bears continue to prevail and the probabilities are higher that the sequence will reach the target level than they would be if the sequence were not activated.
